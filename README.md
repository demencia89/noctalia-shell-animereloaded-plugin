# AnimeReloaded for Noctalia

AnimeReloaded is the next-generation continuation of the original Noctalia Anime plugin.

## Highlights

- AniList-backed browse, search, detail pages, titles, synonyms, relations, seasons, and airing metadata
- AllAnime preserved for episode resolution, stream lookup, and playback
- season-aware detail flow so selecting another season opens that season and its episodes instead of flattening the whole franchise
- local AniList `<->` AllAnime mapping/cache layer for safe playback resolution
- feed focused on currently watched releasing shows that are close to caught up, plus newly relevant release events
- MyAnimeList sync for account progress, without switching in-app metadata away from AniList
- polished Noctalia-native UI with smoother card scrolling, consistent chips/buttons, and refreshed library/settings flows

## What Works Now

- Browse and search are AniList-backed.
- Detail pages use AniList metadata and show season-level navigation, relations, and season-specific episodes.
- Playback still resolves through AllAnime when the user actually starts an episode.
- Library uses MyAnimeList-style list statuses: `Watching`, `Completed`, `On Hold`, `Dropped`, and `Plan To Watch`.
- Library status chips support multi-select filtering, and local status handling now stays aligned with MAL sync semantics.
- Feed tracks releasing seasons you are actively watching and close to current on, then surfaces new episodes when they become relevant.
- Detail and library progress actions support catching up or marking fully watched when appropriate.
- MyAnimeList sync supports browser login, refresh, pull, push, optional auto-push, per-title sync badges, and MAL-aligned status/progress payloads.

## Feed Direction

Feed is no longer treated as a generic “everything in the library that might be airing” list.

Current behavior is centered on actively watched releasing seasons:

- AniList airing status and next-airing data drive eligibility
- only `watching` entries that are near current pace are followed automatically
- titles that drift too far behind fall out of Feed until you catch back up
- followed titles are evaluated as specific AniList season/media entries
- newly relevant episode events are surfaced more clearly
- uncertain legacy mappings are skipped instead of guessed

This keeps Feed aligned with the long-term goal of becoming a practical release notification center.

## MyAnimeList Sync

AnimeReloaded keeps AniList as the canonical in-app metadata source and uses MyAnimeList only for account sync.

Current MAL sync behavior:

- browser auth through the deployed AnimeReloaded MAL backend
- `Pull From MAL` to merge external progress and import MAL-only titles that resolve confidently to AniList
- `Push To MAL` to send both local status and watched-episode progress outward
- optional auto-push after local watch changes
- per-show MAL badges in Library and Detail
- sync overview focused on titles needing attention, ready-to-push titles, and recently synced titles


Status handling now follows MAL-style rules closely:

- new library entries start as `plan_to_watch`
- starting progress promotes them to `watching`
- known completions are pushed as `completed`
- `on_hold` and `dropped` are treated as explicit states rather than inferred guesses

## Local Install

Clone this repository into your Noctalia plugins directory, then enable `AnimeReloaded` from the Plugins view.

```text
~/.config/noctalia/plugins/
└── AnimeReloaded/
```

The root manifest keeps local checkouts loadable, while the actual plugin runtime stays in `anime-reloaded/`.

## Requirements

- `python3` in `$PATH`
- `python3-cryptography` (or equivalent Python `cryptography` package) available to the plugin runtime
- `mpv` in `$PATH`
- network access to AniList, AllAnime, MyAnimeList, and resolved stream hosts

## Local Runtime Files

AnimeReloaded stores local runtime data in the plugin directory with `anime-reloaded-*` names, including:

- `anime-reloaded-library.json`
- `anime-reloaded-feed-cache.json`
- `anime-reloaded-provider-map.json`
- `anime-reloaded-mal-config.json`

`anime-reloaded-mal-config.json` contains local MAL auth/session data and should remain untracked.

## Current Limitations

- Playback still depends on a valid AniList -> AllAnime mapping.
- Some imported MAL titles may sync correctly but still need a resolvable AllAnime mapping before playback works.
- Feed is already airing-aware and progression-aware, but it is still a pragmatic release alert list rather than a full notification platform.
- Legacy library/feed compatibility exists, but not every old entry is migrated in-place automatically.
